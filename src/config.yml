# Tips for editing YAML files:
#   - Do not use TABS! Instead use 4 spaces.
#   - Lines starting with '#' symbol are completely ignored
#   - Indentation matters
#   - If you have any errors, google 'yaml parser' to easily correct them

# MySQL settings to sync warnings in a database.

  database: database
  port: 3306
  username: username
  password: password
  table: warnings

# Set the prefix of the plugin. This gets displayed on all messages sent through the plugin.
prefix: '&8[&6WarningManager&8] '

# Message that gets sent out when a player gets warned. Tags: %TARGET% %REASON% %SENDER%
broadcast-message: '&6Player &c%SENDER% &6has warned &c%PLAYER% &6for &c%REASON%'

# If set to true the broadcast-message will get sent to everyone on the server.
# If set to false the broadcast-message will only get sent to players with warnings.notify permission
broadcast-reason: true

# Reason that will be supplied when the reason argument is not full filled, optional tag is %punishment% which gets replaced with the punishment
default-reason: 'Follow all the rules! (%punishment%)'

# Message that gets sent to the player when they get warned. Type 'none' to ignore. Tags: %SENDER% %REASON% %WARNINGS%
player-message: '&6You now have &7%WARNINGS% &6warnings.'

# Auto command handler. Number is amount of warnings until the 'command' happens.
# Avaible tags are %PLAYER% %SENDER %REASON% %WARNINGS%
# Do not include the '/' at the begining of the command

# A new really cool feature called groups which lets you specify the type of warning and then have dynamic punishments based on that type
# Make a new group by forming 2 spaces, typing in the group name followed by a : (hit enter) then 4 spaces with the warning number and : (hit enter) command: then "" with the command inside it. Then do /wreload
# Follow the defaults for examples
